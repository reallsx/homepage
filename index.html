        <p>
          I finished a PhD in Physics at Rice University in 2025, after I had
          a BS in Physics from USTC in 2019. During my PhD I worked on experimental
          particle physics stuff which involves data processing with ML techniques, statistical
          inference, software development and of course modeling and analysis. Currently I am
          a postdoc at Baylor College of Medicine working on ML applications in medical imaging and radiation therapy.

          <br>
          I'm looking for positions related to software engineering, data science, ML engineering,
          and research. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I post stuff in <a href="https://blog.trashfish.cc">my blog</a>,
          and I aim to use AI as less as possible for non-technical stuff.

          Besides those, I spent quite some time on music. I've been playing
          classical guitar for more than 10 years and I was in students' choir
          during my undergrad years. I kinda eat everything too.
